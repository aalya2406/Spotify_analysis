# Spotify_analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Spotify music data to uncover trends, predict popularity, and recommend songs using machine learning. It combines exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and interactive prediction tools to gain insight into what makes a song popular.

This project is a data analysis and machine learning application built with Python. It analyzes audio features from songs to:

Predict song popularity (regression)

Classify the mood of a song (classification)

Recommend songs using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Generate mood-based playlists based on user input

Machine Learning Models Used
Popularity Prediction:	Random Forest Regressor;	R² Score, RMSE
Mood Classification:	Decision Tree Classifier;	Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

Analysis Highlights
✅ Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and normalized data.

📈 Correlation Heatmap: Visualized how features correlate with popularity and mood.

🧪 Model Training: Tested multiple ML models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN).

🎯 Evaluation: Used R² and RMSE for regression, classification report and confusion matrix for mood classification.

🔁 User Interaction: Users can input a song or mood to get predictions or curated playlists.
